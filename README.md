## Purpose

The Skewb Solving Robot is designed to receieve the state of a scanned Skewb, find the solution from a list of all solutions, and execute rotations using a four-motor system.

## Features

- Website using device camera to scan Skewb state
- Semi-autonomous Skewb solving from any valid state
- Distance sensor for cube placement verification
- LED touch sensor for start/abort control
- Encoder-based closed-looped control for rotation accuracy
    - Less cubes destroyed and faster solves

## Hardware

- 4x [VEX IQ Smart Motors](https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-2560.html)
- 1x [IQ Optical Sensor](https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-7082.html)
- 1x [IQ Distance Sensor](https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-7106.html)
- 1x [LED Touch Sensor](https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-3010.html)

## Software

The control system is written in C++ using the VEXcodeIQ. The robot pulls from a compressed bin file that contains all the optimal ways to solve a Skewb in the fewest amount of moves. This data was found through a BFS taken from the solution state and inversing the moves to find the solution at every new position reached. This data was then compressed into a bin file by bitpacking each skewb state and it's solution into unsigned 64 and 32 bit integers respectively.
